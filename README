This sample demonstrates creating a sprite using the VDP1 and moving it with
the standard gamepad.

Until noted; this sample will not use any libraries from the SEGA Saturn SDK,
as they have not yet been authored.

Currently, there is no provided IP.BIN file.  An IP Maker tool is being created
to facilitate the generation of IP.BIN.

Options:
* = default option
ISO - False | Do not create an ISO image *
